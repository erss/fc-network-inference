# functional-connectivity-network-inference
Infers dynamic networks using cross-correlation, spline-Granger, coherence pairwise, and coherence groupwise, and includes spectral analysis.

Requires Chronux package.

Implementation of cross-correlation procedure is from:

M. A. Kramer, U. T. Eden, S. S. Cash, E. D. Kolaczyk, 
Network inference with confidence from multivariate time series,
Phys Rev E, 79: 061916, 2009.

Implementation of spline-Granger procedure is from the manuscript:  A procedure to increase power of Granger-causal analysis through temporal smoothing.
